* for mechanistic-based gene network Inference
* along with a Stochastic Simulation Algorithm

**NB:** This repository is still under construction... but will hopefully be ready soon


#### Basic info

The package depends on the following standard scientific libraries:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
