This is a Python package for inferring gene networks from single-cell data.
It consists in:
- **H**artree **A**pproximation and **R**andom fields
- for mechanistic-based gene network **I**nference
- along with a **S**tochastic **S**imulation **A**lgorithm

**NB:** This repository is still under construction... but will be ready soon

The package is based on Python 3 and uses the following standard scientific libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

It was tested with numpy 1.13.3, scipy 1.0.0 and matplotlib 2.1.1, but should work with any recent version.
