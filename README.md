# Harissa

### Tools for mechanistic-based gene network inference
This is a Python package for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell data. Its name comes from ‘**Har**tree approximation for **i**nference along with a **s**tochastic **s**imulation **a**lgorithm.’

This package was implemented in the context of a [mechanistic approach to gene regulatory network inference from single-cell data](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0487-0).

This repository is still under construction but will improve soon.
Please see the [tutorials](https://github.com/ulysseherbach/harissa/tree/master/tutorials) folder for some demos.

### Dependencies
The package depends on the following standard scientific libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`.
